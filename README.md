# Ultrasonic_Distance_Meter

# Proposal
Project Significance: Knowing the apartment area is very important for deciding the amount of taxes a tenant must pay. Apartment price also depends on the square footage. My Ultrasonic Distance Meter facilitates area calculations as the user only needs to measure the distance to two walls (length and width of the room), and the area will be calculated for him by the device. While the measuring wheel is easily obstructed by objects like bedside stands and desks, the ultrasonic sensor can measure the distance to the wall from any point. 

Technical Description: I will utilize Arduinp along with a HC-SR04 (ultrasonic distance sensor module), LCD, and buttons to turn the project on/off and switch between different modes. The display will list the distance from the sensor to the wall (or another object of interest). After measuring distances to two walls, the length and the width will be stored in memory. Upon pressing one of four buttons, the area will be displayed on the display. I will use C++ for the code.

Tentative Timeline: I will break the project into three logical phases:
* Making a simple model, where the distance between the object and a sensor appears on the display. At this point, I will only have one button to turn the project on and off.
* Adding a second button, so that upon pressing it, the distance measured gets saved in the memory. Then, I will add another button, so the second measurement will get saved to the memory as well.
* Putting the project together and adding the fourth button to display the area.
